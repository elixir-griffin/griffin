## Griffin

> ⚠️ Griffin is in alpha stage, under active development and is subject to major changes as it evolves from community feedback and improvements. Expect rough edges and parts that don't work. Griffin will have a `1.0.0` release when it's considered stable.

Griffin is a framework for building static sites inspired by [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and others. It's purposely made to feel familiar to Elixir and Phoenix users.

## Getting started
