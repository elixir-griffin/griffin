## Griffin

> ⚠️ Griffin is in alpha stage and is subject to major changes as it evolves from community feedback and improvements. Expect rough edges and parts that don't work. Griffin will have a `1.0.0` release when it's considered stable.

Griffin is a framework for building static sites inspired by [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and others. It's purposely made to feel familiar to Elixir and Phoenix users.

## Getting started

Install the latest version of Griffin by following the latest instructions on the hex.pm [documentation page](https://hexdocs.pm/griffin_ssg)
