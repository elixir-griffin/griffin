- Added page for explaining core concepts (`guides/getting_started/core_concepts.md`)
- Added page explaining content dates (`guides/working_with_templates/content_dates.md`)
- Added page explaining build process (`guides/architecture/build_process.md`)

### Fixes

- Remove mandatory `.html.eex` extension restriction for Layouts and Partials
- Add missing tests for most configuration options of `mix grf.build`
- Fix an issue where the page title could not be changed

### Architecture

- Files are no longer parsed and rendered in the same parallel step.
  Instead, they are first parsed into their front matter and content parts and collected
  into an `Enum`. This enables compilation of collections of pages, that can be used to iterate
  over any group of pages that uses the same front matter `tags`.

## 0.2.0 (2023-03-23)

Partial rewrite of the project.

### Features

- `mix grf.build` now accepts command line arguments to configure multiple parameters
- Use multi-source configuration that is merged at the start of the build process according to a hierarchy (Environment Variables > Command Line Arguments > Application Config > Defaults)
- Added Github action for CI that runs tests and added CI badges to the README file.
- Layed foundation for robust tests for `mix grf.build`

### Documentation

- Added Getting Started guide, rewrote existing introductory docs
- Created doc pages for most of upcoming features, using a doc structure heavily inspired by [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/).
- Added module docs to core Elixir modules

### Fixes

- Fixed a bug that would raise when no files were generated
- Removed theme related code since it doesn't work yet

### Architecture

- The abstraction that `GriffinSSG` provides for parsing and rendering was changed.
  It no longer handles any files and instead handles binary contents.
  This makes for a cleaner abstraction without side effects that can be better tested.

## 0.1.0 (2022-06-10)

Genesis version.

### Features

- Multiple configurable options via Application environment
- Add support for `.html.eex` layouts and partials
- Phoenix-like `grf.new` installer
