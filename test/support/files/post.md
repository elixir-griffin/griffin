# Griffin Static Site Generator
Griffin is a framework for building static sites inspired by [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and others. It's purposely made to feel familiar to Elixir and Phoenix users.

## Getting started
Install the latest version of Griffin by following the latest instructions on the hex.pm [package page](https://hexdocs.pm/griffin_ssg/installation.html#griffin)
